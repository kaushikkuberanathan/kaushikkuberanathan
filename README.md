# Hi, I’m Kaushik 👋

I’m a product leader focused on building **scalable digital platforms**, **mobile-first experiences**, and **thoughtful AI-assisted systems** that help people make better decisions — whether that’s customers using products or professionals navigating their careers.

I’ve spent my career working at the intersection of:
- Product strategy & execution
- Platform and API-driven systems
- Digital commerce and self-service
- Regulatory, trust, and transparency-heavy domains
- AI as a decision-support tool (not a replacement for judgment)

This GitHub is where I share **experiments, frameworks, and tools** that reflect how I think about product, careers, and systems.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

### 🚀 AI + Career Strategy
- **Kaushik’s Career Strategy Team (Custom GPT)**  
  A multi-persona career decision engine modeled after how hiring *actually* works (Recruiter + HRBP + Resume Strategist).

### 🧩 Side Projects & Experiments

- Lightweight systems that reduce cognitive load for humans
- Exploring how AI can support—not override—judgment

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration On
I’m always interested in collaborating with people who care about **quality, clarity, and long-term thinking**, especially around:

- AI-assisted productivity (career, product, decision-making)
- Prompt systems that behave like products
- Thoughtful tooling for senior professionals
- Open-source frameworks that help people *think better*, not just move faster

If that resonates, I’m happy to chat.
