# Hi, I’m Kaushik 👋

I’m a product leader focused on building **scalable digital platforms**, **mobile-first experiences**, and **thoughtful AI-assisted systems** that help people make better decisions — whether that’s customers using products or professionals navigating their careers.

I’ve spent my career working at the intersection of:
- Product strategy & execution
- Platform and API-driven systems
- Digital commerce and self-service
- Regulatory, trust, and transparency-heavy domains
- AI as a decision-support tool (not a replacement for judgment)

**Tech & Focus Areas** · Product Strategy · AI Decision Tools · Prompt Engineering · Platform Architecture · Mobile-First · Measurement-Driven · Trust & Transparency

This GitHub is where I share **experiments, frameworks, and tools** that reflect how I think about product, careers, and systems.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

### 🚀 AI + Career Strategy
- **Kaushik’s Career Strategy Team (Custom GPT)**  
  A multi-persona career decision engine modeled after how hiring *actually* works (Recruiter + HRBP + Resume Strategist).  
  → https://chatgpt.com/g/g-69149958111c81918774f96ef886d90e-kaushik-s-career-strategy-team

- Prompt frameworks for:  
  - Resume and LinkedIn positioning (truth-first, no fabrication)  
  - Role fit assessment and tradeoff analysis  
  - Interview prep and negotiation strategy  
  - Senior IC → leadership transitions

### 📱 Digital Platforms & Product Systems
- Mobile app ecosystems at scale  
- Native eCommerce and self-service journeys  
- Platform foundations that enable speed without sacrificing trust  
- API-first thinking and reusable capability design  
- Measurement-driven product strategy (not vanity metrics)

### 🧩 Side Projects & Experiments
- AI-assisted product discovery and documentation  
- Prompt engineering as a *product interface*  
- Lightweight systems that reduce cognitive load for humans  
- Exploring how AI can support—not override—judgment

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration On

I’m always interested in collaborating with people who care about **quality, clarity, and long-term thinking**, especially around:
- AI-assisted productivity (career, product, decision-making)  
- Prompt systems that behave like products  
- Thoughtful tooling for senior professionals  
- Open-source frameworks that help people *think better*, not just move faster  

💬 **Ask me about**: career transitions, prompt systems as product interfaces, building trust-heavy platforms, or why judgment > automation.

If that resonates, I’m happy to chat.
