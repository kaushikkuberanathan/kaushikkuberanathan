# Hi, I’m Kaushik 👋

I’m a product leader focused on building **scalable digital platforms**, **mobile-first experiences**, and **thoughtful AI-assisted systems** that help people make better decisions — whether that’s customers using products or professionals navigating their careers.

I’ve spent my career working at the intersection of:
- Product strategy & execution
- Platform and API-driven systems
- Digital commerce and self-service
- Regulatory, trust, and transparency-heavy domains
- AI as a decision-support tool (not a replacement for judgment)

This GitHub is where I share **experiments, frameworks, and tools** that reflect how I think about product, careers, and systems.

I’m always interested in collaborating with people who care about **quality, clarity, and long-term thinking**, especially around:

> I believe good systems respect human judgment, not replace it.  
> Most of what I build starts with that principle.
